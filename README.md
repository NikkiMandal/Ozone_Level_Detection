# Ozone Level Detection Using Machine Learning Pipelines

This project aims to analyze and predict ozone levels to improve air quality management. Using historical data from the Houston, Galveston, and Brazoria areas, we will develop a model to detect peak ozone levels. The model will help in timely intervention and reducing health risks associated with high ozone levels.

# Dataset Introduction:
The dataset includes records from 1998 to 2004 for eight-hour and one-hour peak ozone levels. It contains 72 features and 2536 instances, focusing on atmospheric conditions like temperature, wind speed, and humidity.

# Data Rights and Privacy:
The dataset is publicly available for research purposes with no specific data privacy concerns, but general data protection principles should be followed.
